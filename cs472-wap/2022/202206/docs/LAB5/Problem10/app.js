/**
 * 10.	Write a function named, computeSumOfSquaresOfEvensOnly,
 *  that takes as input, an array of integral numbers and calculates 
 * and returns the sum of the squares of only the even numbers in 
 * the input array. E.g. computeSumOfSquaresOfEvensOnly ([1,2,3,4,5]) 
 * should be computed as 22 +42 = 20.
